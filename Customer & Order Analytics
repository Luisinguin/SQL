-- In this SQL Project, I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

-- Selects all data from BIT_DB JanSales
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

-- How many orders were placed in January? Also filters blank and incorrect order IDs
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'OrderID';

-- How many of those orders were for an iPhone
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = "iPhone"
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

-- slect the customer account numbers for all the orders that were place in Feb
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
ON cust.order_id = FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'OrderID';

-- What product was the cheapest one sold in January and what was the price?
SELECT product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT distinct proudct, SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY total_revenue;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)* price AS Revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, How many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)* price AS Revenue, location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;

-- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in Feb and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum) AS cust, avg(quantity*price) AS average_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
